# Spotify Clustering

This is my third capstone project at Thinkful's Data Science Immersion.

For this project, I am utilizing a dataset that was uploaded to Kaggle via Spotify's API. This dataset contains over 230,000 songs and each song contains various characteristics including popularity, liveness, acousticness, loudness, energy, instrumentalness etc. 

For preprocessing, I utilized three dimensionality reduction processes: PCA, t-SNE and UMAP, and compared them to two different clustering algorithms: K-means and DBSCAN.
